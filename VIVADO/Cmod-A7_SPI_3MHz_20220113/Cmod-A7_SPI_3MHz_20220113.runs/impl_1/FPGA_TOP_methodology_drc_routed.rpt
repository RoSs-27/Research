2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clkgen/inst/ICLK12MHZ is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_spi_clk_d2_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clkgen/inst/ICLK12MHZ is created on an inappropriate internal pin clkgen/inst/ICLK12MHZ. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
